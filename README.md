# ReactPractice

For this afternoon session, you will create a React app. 
Create three components. 
  Header.js, 
  Footer.js  
  Random.js. 
  
This React application should create random numbers and display them in the browser after the user clicks a button. 
Style the app to your specifications. 
However, there should be items centered on the page. 
Due at the end of the day today.
